- How do we define a graph mathematically?
    - G = (V,E) v- verticies and E - Edges
- What is the difference between directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted?
    - directed Graph : Edges with direction or flow (one direction)
    - undirected Graph : Edges without direction (two - direction)
    - weighted Graph : each edge assigned some cost
    - unweighted Graph: Edges with no cost
- Give an example of various types of graphs (Weighted Undirected, Unweighted Directed, Unweighted Undirected, etc.)

- What makes a graph a simple graph? What attributes would make it not simple?
    - A simple graph is an undirected graph with neither multiple edges nor loops.
    - multiple edges and directed graph
- What is the maximum number of edges in a directed simple graph? Undirected simple graph? Answer should be in terms of `N`
    - Directed = N * (N - 1)
    - Undirected = N * (N - 1) / 2
- Describe the levels of connectivity a graph can have (strongly connected, weakly connected).
    - Strongly connected : Path from any vertex to any other vertex
-  What are cycles?
- What are some naive ways we can store and traverse graphs? Be able to discuss time/space complexity of these approaches, and what issues we may face.  
- What are the three **primary** Fielding constraints? (Bonus if you can say who Fielding is!)
- What sub-constraints make up a **Uniform Interface**
- Walk through an arbitrary example of a RESTful request/response cycle, and describe _**what**_ makes it RESTful
- Give a high level overview of what an object's prototype represents
- What are the differences between the `__proto__` and `prototype` attributes?
- What happens when we **do** or **don't** explicity set an object's prototype?
- What is an object's **default** prototype?
- What are the valid values for an object's prototype?
- Name 5 benefits of HTML5
- What is `localStorage`? How might you use it?
- Why are media queries useful?
- What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
